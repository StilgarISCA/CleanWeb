CleanWeb
========

PHP code to make an important-text only browsing experience.

History
=======

WebClean started around 2002 with my Sony Cli√© which ran PalmOS.

This device did not have any built-in internet capability, but there was a free web browser application called AvantGo. AvantGo would allow you to enter in web URLs or select from a list of pre-existing sites to browse. When you synced your PalmOS device with Palm Desktop, AvantGo would connect to the internet and download some amount of web content which you could view later on your PalmOS device.

The pre-existing sites that I mentioned were specially crafted (or maybe formatted) for AvantGo viewing. Unfortunately, any other URLs you put in would just typical web content designed for higher resolution computer browsers. As you can imagine, it wasn't a very good experience to get high resolution ads, images and giant horizontal scroll bars.

So I had an idea to make a scrubber that would try to rip out everything from a website that wasn't page content, and CleanWeb was born.  Initially, it started as a series of simple functions and regular expressions that I added to over time. You could also refer to this has hacked together code. :)

Alas, my PalmOS device didn't last very long and I ended up switching back to a Franklin Planner for several years. Eventually, I purchased a smart phone, and ten years after CleanWeb's initial creation, I stumbled across the old code on my on my web host.

Due to slow mobile internet browsing, mobile ads, sites and videos, I found CleanWeb to once again be relavent and I worked on it a bit more.

Which leads me to now, where I thought I'd place this code in my GitHub site and if I continue to make improvements to it I will have a nice public repository to track my efforts.
